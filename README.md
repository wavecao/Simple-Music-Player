# Simple-Music-Player
这是一个简单的音乐播放器软件，利用Java语言制作，其UI使用到了Java FX。
界面仿于网易云音乐，提供简单的列表，播放，暂停等功能。音量调教功能利用vbs脚本（在lib文件夹下），只适用于Windows。
其实这是大二上学期Java编程课的大作业，代码逻辑很乱，代码质量也差，项目层次也没分好，放在Git上纯粹为了备份。
如果您有意改善它，我非常高兴能够学到新的东西，请您随意提交。
如果它对你有帮助，我将倍感荣幸！



The following text is from Google Translate

This is a simple music player software, made in Java, and its UI uses Java FX.
The interface is similar to NetEase cloud music, providing simple list, play, pause and other functions. The volume adjustment function utilizes the vbs script (under the lib folder) and is only available for Windows.
In fact, this is the big homework of the Java programming class in the second semester of the sophomore year. The code logic is messy, the code quality is also poor, and the project level is not well divided. It is placed on Git purely for backup.
If you are interested in improving it, I am very happy to learn something new, please feel free to submit it.
I would be honored if it helped you!
